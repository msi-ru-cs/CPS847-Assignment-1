[Slack Workspace](https://app.slack.com/client/TT47LCF9S/learning-slack)

## Steps

- [x] Create Slack Team (i.e., workspace) for your lab group
- [x] Create GitHub repo for your group
- [x] Add ZenHub shell to your GitHub repo (5%)
- [x] Integrate ZenHub notifications into Slack and create #zenhub slack channel for the notifications (5%)
- [x] Integrate GitHub notifications into Slack and create #github slack channel for the notifications (5%)
- [x] Create two Epics with two issues/requirements in each in ZenHub (5%)
- [x] Add estimates to each issue (select estimate values at random) (5%)
- [x] Create (5%)
      - “Sprint 1” starting on Jan 27, 2020, and ending on Feb 09, 2020
      - “Sprint 2” starting on Feb 10, 2020, and ending on Feb 24, 2020
- [x] For each Epic, assign one issue/requirement to Sprint 1 and the other one -- to Sprint 2 (5%)
- [x] Close first issue in Sprint 1 (5%)
- [x] Close Sprint 1 (5%)
- [x] Add users msi-ru-cs and avm-ru-cs to GitHub account (5%)
- [x] Send an invite to your slack group to mohammad.s.islam@ryerson.ca (5%)
- [ ] Build Slack bot echoing questions asked to the bot, add it to your Slack group (10%)
      - You will have to run your bot from your machine in the lab so that we can validate its functionality
- [x] Commit the source code of your Slack bot to GitHub repository (5%)
- [x] Create file ./git\_tst/index.html with some content (5%)
- [x] Create two additional branches and modify./git\_tst/index.html in both of these branches in such a way that a merge conflict will be provoked. Merge both branches into the master branch and resolve the conflict (10%)
- [x] While committing the code in step 17, close one of the issues created in step 6 using commit message. (5%)
- [ ] Create a pull request with a branch name cps847-pull-1 for some modification of ./git\_tst/index.html; do the code review (by commenting on the commit in the pull request); merge and close the commit. (10%)


**Note Step 14a: at least one of the group members should come to the lab on Feb. 6 to show to the TA “live” bot so that he can test it.**
